## BangleJS AppLoader Fork

Forked from original repository for custom app testing

### Main Difference

All apps in the Loader are the same, aside from the addition of my own `sensorClock` app, which is currently in early testing


Purpose for the added sensorClock app:

- **Allows for Gadgetbridge communication of home temperatures via a primary app**
- **Adds new icon below weather reading to display home temperature value**

# TODO

- Create a standalone app to display multiple sensor readings
- These readings will all come from the primary mobile app, communicating through Gadgetbridge
- **In order to facilitate this, a customized version of Gadgetbridge is being built to include this additional functionality**


For more details, occasionally check [our website blog](https://www.nullreturn-it.com/blog).


### Support Info or Contact

Having issues running the app? Remember that we are in early development of the sensorClock, and not all of it is ready for any kind of daily use. This repo acts as a hub for testing on our BangleJS and for easy coding on various devices. Due to the fact that this is a fork of the main AppLoader repo, it must remain public. Any contributions and thoughts are always welcome!

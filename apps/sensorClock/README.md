# Home Sensor Weather Clock

A clock which displays the current weather conditions, as well as home sensor temperature readings forwarded from our Android app via Gadgetbridge.

This app is possible and based almost entirely on the excellent "Weather Clock" app for BangleJS!

All functionality of the original app is still in place, with small additions to facilitate displaying temperature data for a smart home sensor.

## Requirements

**This clock requires Gadgetbridge and the weather app in order to get weather data!**

See the [Bangle.js Gadgetbridge documentation](https://www.espruino.com/Gadgetbridge) for instructions on setting up Gadgetbridge and weather.
